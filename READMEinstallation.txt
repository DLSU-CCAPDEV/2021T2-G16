Good Day, this is COLLABORATIVE. An application meant for team collaboration projects using a Kanban Board.
This idea is inspired directly from the Trello board, but we decided to put our own spin on it.

We had a great time (and bad times) in building this project, from the ground up. Although we may have
overestimated our abilities as we go, it's nice to put into practical all the fundamental that we have
been learning in our College life. Thank you.

Moving on, on how to locally run this project. Do note that the actual project files is instilled on
directory "./application" - the other files are miscallenous and unrelated.

INSTALLATION and SET-UP:

This project is a product of our passion. We could have done more if we had much more time, but
it is a learning experience - and a fun one, at that. Have fun!

NOTE: There is a bug in terms of editing the Kanban data. Adding and deleting files works
as intended; however, editing the data does not change it. We would like to let you know
that the problem may rest in the dependency itself and not the program.
